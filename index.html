      <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
      <p class="cursive">
        Mexicana.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently studying data science and public policy in the <a href="https://capp.uchicago.edu">
          M.S. in Computational Analysis and Public Policy </a>
        at The University of Chicago.
        (Thanks to the support of CONACYT, UChicago, P.E.O.
        International, FUNED). <br> <br>
        My current interests are the applications of data science (particularly, machine learning methods
        and human-AI interaction) that aim to address social issues such as social inequality gaps (e.g. health care
        access, gender income gaps), crime prevention and government transparency.
        <br>
        Previously, I was an economist in the Central Bank of Mexico doing monetary policy research.

            With Charlie Sheils and MengChen Chung, we built a data pipeline to clean, calibrate and

            To join the efforts to fight COVID-19, along with Roberto Barroso, Steph Ramos and Oscar Noriega,
            I studied and predicted severe disease outcomes for COVID-19 patients in Mexico .
            The predictions were useful in developing a relative risk index between Mexican states.

            In an effort to further study and address mass incarceration in the U.S.,
            we examine the rates of recidivism across several social dimensions such as mental illness prevalence,
            emotional difficulties and family conditions (e.g. foster care, homelessness),
            using the data from the BJS 2016 Inmates Survey.

            Motivated by the growing crime incidence in Mexico City (CDMX),
            this web-app aims to provide the user information on the number of crimes that happened at a
            specified place, day of the week, and hour, with the purpose of the user potentially
            taking certain precautions when going to a specified area given that time and day of the week.

          <p> Through Unity and #C, Kelsey Anderson and I built an Educational video game about Climate Change for 10 to
            12-year-olds. The goal is to provide the children with an understanding of how their behaviors in daily life
            relate to the global environment.

            Given the rise in anti-immigrant sentiment in recent years,
            I analyze the evolution of hate groups and crimes against
            the immigrant community in the United States.
            In this analysis, I was able to identify risk regions characterized
            by a greater number of groups or hate crimes per million population.
            Also, I developed a simple Shiny dashboard to represent this data.
