      <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
      <p class="cursive">
        Mexicana.
      </p>
      <p>
        I just recently graduated with honors from the <a href="https://capp.uchicago.edu">
          MSc. in Computational Analysis and Public Policy </a>
        at The University of Chicago.
        (Thanks to the support of CONACYT, UChicago, P.E.O.
        International, FUNED). Now, I'm looking for data scientist roles
        where I can support organizations to make data-driven decisions.
        If you are looking for a data scientist or just wandering here,
        don't forget to check out my projects below. :)
        <br> <br>
        My current interests are the applications of data science (particularly, machine learning methods
        and human-AI interaction) that aim to address social issues such as social inequality gaps (e.g. health care
        access, gender and income gaps), social mobility and climate change.
        <br>
        Previously, I was an economist in the Central Bank of Mexico doing monetary policy research.

            With Kelsey Anderson and Stephanie Ramos, we built different supervised
            machine learning models to test if the text extracted from tweets posted
            by news media accounts is predictive of the polarization in the comments
            they receive. We used logistic regression, recurrent and convolutional neural
            networks to predict polarization in comments with 65% accuracy.
            Our research aims to contribute to creating a more civil and less polarized
            space for discourse on social media.

            To join the efforts to fight COVID-19, along with Roberto Barroso, Steph Ramos and Oscar Noriega,
            I studied and predicted severe disease outcomes for COVID-19 patients in Mexico .
            The predictions were useful in developing a relative risk index between Mexican states.

            In an effort to further study and address mass incarceration in the U.S.,
            we examine the rates of recidivism across several social dimensions such as mental illness prevalence,
            emotional difficulties and family conditions (e.g. foster care, homelessness),
            using the data from the BJS 2016 Inmates Survey.

            Motivated by the growing crime incidence in Mexico City (CDMX),

            specified place, day of the week, and hour, with the purpose of the user potentially
            taking certain precautions when going to a specified area given that time and day of the week.

            Given the rise in anti-immigrant sentiment in recent years,
            I analyze the evolution of hate groups and crimes against
            the immigrant community in the United States.
            In this analysis, I was able to identify risk regions characterized
            by a greater number of groups or hate crimes per million population.
            Also, I developed a simple Shiny dashboard to represent this data.
