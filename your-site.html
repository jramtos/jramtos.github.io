          <p>ABOUT ME</p>
          <cursive>Mexicana.</cursive> <br> <br>

            I'm currently studying data science and public policy in the <a href= "https://capp.uchicago.edu">
            Computational Analysis and Public Policy master's program</a>
            at the Univerity of Chicago. <br>

              International, FUNED, Harris School of Public Policy UChicago)
            </small>  <br> <br>
            My current interests are the applications of data science that aim to address
            social issues such as social inequality gaps, crime prevention, government transparency.
            <br> <br>
            Previously, I was an economist in the Central Bank of Mexico doing monetary policy research.

            COVID-19 in Mexico: Predicting severe disease outcomes using health and socioeconomic variables.
          </a>
        </dt>
        <dd> 
          To join the efforts to fight COVID-19, along with Roberto Barroso, Steph Ramos and Oscar Noriega, 
          I studied and predicted severe disease outcomes for COVID-19 patients in Mexico . 
          The predictions were useful in developing a relative risk index between Mexican states.

            Understanding the Anti-immigration sentiment in the U.S. with hate-crime data
          </a>
        </dt>
        <dd> 
          Given the rise in anti-immigrant sentiment in recent years, 
          I analyze the evolution of hate groups and crimes against 
          the immigrant community in the United States. 
          In this analysis, I was able to identify risk regions characterized 
          by a greater number of groups or hate crimes per million population. 
          Also, I developed a simple Shiny dashboard to represent this data.

          <dd> Through Unity and #C, Kelsey Anderson and I built an Educational video game 
            about Climate Change for 10 to 12 year olds. The goal is to provide the children
            with an understanding of how their behaviors in daily life relate to the global environment.

          </a>
        </dt>
        <dd> Motivated by the growing crime incidence in Mexico City (CDMX),
            this web-app aims to provide the user information on the number of crimes that happened at an
            specified place, day of the week, and hour, with the purpose of the user potentially 
            taking certain precautions when going to a specified area given that time and day of the week.
